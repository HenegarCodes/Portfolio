# Portfolio



## Description

When beginning this project I set out to put together a simple HTML/CSS project to display my proects on a portfolio website. Quickly though it became a larger undertaking when I had visions of items in specific spots and it came to frutiion. I am very pleased with being able to create this website. I plan on updating it whenever i create something new or learn new items to make the website as it is better. Having this website will allow me to market myself better to future employers and connections. I learned to use HTML/CSS in a semantic and also necessary pattern that works.
